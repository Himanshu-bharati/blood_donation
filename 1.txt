We want people donating blood to be informed of the blood they were donating is delivered to the needy.


To provide a simple interface for people who wants to donate so that it looks simple and legit.


As many people sometimes are unaware of the blood donating camps happening in the area around them, they can access our application easily and help in blood donation

Many users simply do not wish to get disturbed by number of phone calls when they are not ready or willing to donate blood, so they can turn their notification on and off in our application.
