1.Most probably every one out of five patients who is admitted needs blood during any case of emergency. 


2.We ask if someone in the patients family or relative has a matching blood group and is capable of donating , 
if donating is not possible from any then we try to get from our nearest blood bank.


3.The problems which we face is that many times if we don't get blood, the relatives or family members of patients
 start panicking and cannot decide what to do. The situation turns worse w
hen that blood group is not available even in
the blood banks. Given that supplies are made by donation only, it would be difficult for hospitals to always
have enough blood on hand to handle any possible situation.
On such a situation the patient may die without the appropriate blood transfusion. 
Until we all improve the continuous supply of blood, there will be similar situations where a patient needs blood,
and the hospital doesn’t have it.

4.Yes, 
having a software and connecting people with it may surely be helpful and more and more people will be aware of the 
situations when during emergency.

5.Automation of getting blood from donors so that blood may be available for transfusion when in need.
6.We need an easy to use interface for our donors and our staff

 members.
7.No, we do not have any such software application which is highly popularized for blood donation.
